Energy Prediction Model using Machine Learning and using Python GUI using Tkinter

Use of ML in an Energy Plant


Machine learning algorithms is used to determine energy demand  on a particular day.
 This is done by tracking how daily energy consumption changes for individual customers over time.

Machine Learning models are able to generate very accurate energy demand and consumption forecasts.
 Those predictions could be used by facilities and building managers, energy companies and utilities companies to deploy energy-saving policies.
 Manufacturing companies with prediction can help make plans of how to optimize the particular operations and energy storage systems
.
Furthermore, based on city weather conditions, it can be predicted which cities are best suited for installation of new power plants



Data Set Information:

A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines
(GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a
CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which
are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to
another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the
Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT
performance.
For comparability with our baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold
statistical tests be carried out, we provide the data shuffled five times.
For each shuffling 2-fold CV is carried out and the resulting 10
measurements are used for statistical testing.

Attribute Information:

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables
? - Temperature (T) in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C,
? - Ambient Pressure (AP) in the range 992.89-1033.30 milibar,
? - Relative Humidity (RH) in the range 25.56% to 100.16%
? - Exhaust Vacuum (V) in teh range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg
? - Net hourly electrical energy output (EP) 420.26-495.76 MW

The averages are taken from various sensors located around the plant
that record the ambient variables every second. The variables are
given without normalization.
